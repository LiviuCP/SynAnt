0. Introduction

This program retrieves a word pair that can be synonyms or antonyms and mixes them. The user should guess the correct words. There are 3 difficulty levels.

1. Installation

Currently there are 2 branches, each of them containing a version of the application: qWidgetsVersion and qmlVersion. Choose the branch you would like to use and then compile it.

After compiling the code copy the data file near the executable. For Linux Systems refer to the Application sub-directory. For OS X it should be near the executable placed within the .app directory. Feel free to modify it by adding new word pairs.

The file should be named "data", otherwise it won't be recognized by the app.

2. Supported Operating Systems

This program has been compiled on OS X and Linux (Fedora and OpenSUSE). It hasn't been tested on Windows so far.

3. Updating the data file

Use = for separating synonym word pairs and ! for antonyms.

The minimum word size is 5 characters and is determined by the minWordSize constant (see function retrieveWords() from wordmixer.cpp).
