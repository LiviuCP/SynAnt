0. Introduction

This program retrieves a word pair that can be synonyms or antonyms and mixes them. The user should guess the correct words. There are 3 difficulty levels.

1. Installation

After compiling the code copy the data file near the executable. Feel free to modify it by adding new word pairs.

2. Updating the data file

Use = for separating synonym word pairs and ! for antonyms.

The minimum word size is 5 characters and is determined by the minWordSize constant (see function retrieveWords() from wordmixer.cpp).
