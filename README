0. Introduction

This program retrieves a word pair that can either be synonyms or antonyms, divides them in (almost) equal pieces and mixes them. The user should guess the correct words. There are 3 difficulty levels based on the word piece size.

1. Installation

Currently there are 2 branches, each of them containing a version of the application: qWidgetsVersion and qmlVersion (the master branch currently replicates qmlVersion). Choose the branch you would like to use and then compile it.

After compiling the code copy the file "data" near the executable from the Application sub-directory. Feel free to modify it by adding new word pairs.

The file should keep its name ("data"), otherwise it won't be recognized by the app and an error will be triggered.

2. Supported Operating Systems

This program has been compiled on Linux (Fedora 28) using Qt 5.9.2 and a 64bit GCC-C++ compiler. It is currently not supported on OS-X/Mac OS or Windows.

3. Updating the "data" file

Currently the file can only be updated manually. In a future version I'm planning to add functionality that allows "update through the app" without even needing to know the file name.

Each row should contain one word pair. The 2 words from each pair are separated by a special character which is '=' for synonyms and '!' for antonyms. No rows should be left empty or with incorrect format (e.g. no separator/multiple separators) otherwise an exception will be triggered when reading the incorrect row and the program will stop.

The minimum word size is 5 characters and is determined by the c_MinWordSize constant from Common/game.h.
