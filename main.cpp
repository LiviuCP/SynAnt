/*

   This program implements a small game which is played as follows:
   - the application reads 2 words from a file
   - the words are divided into small pieces
   - all pieces are mixed into a single string array
   - the user will have to guess and enter the 2 words
   - the application will advise if the words were correctly guessed

   The program consists of three window types. Only one will be displayed at any moment. The window types are:
   - the introduction window: class IntroductionWindow
   - the main game window: class MainGameWindow
   - the hints window: class HintsWindow

   An additional class (WordMixer) will be used for:
   - reading the words and mixing them into a single one
   - verifying if the words entered by user match the actual words

   A second additional class (ScoreItem) will be used for keeping track of the score.

   An application manager (AppManager) will be responsible for creating and connecting the windows.
